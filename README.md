## Offline AI Agricultural Assistant for Smallholder Farmers

FarmGuardian AI is an intelligent agricultural assistant designed to help Nigerian smallholder farmers detect crop problems, understand climate risks, and receive practical farming recommendations.

The project combines agricultural knowledge, AI preparation, climate awareness, and farmer digital records to provide accessible agricultural support even in areas with limited internet access.

Built for the **Google Gemma Hackathon - Track 3: Safe Communities (SDG 11 & SDG 13)**.
